## Cleaning Steps:

1.Removal of Special Characters: The salary estimate column contained special characters such as "âˆ’" (minus sign) and "K" (representing thousands). These characters were removed to clean up the salary values.   

2.Handling Missing Values: Any missing values in the dataset were addressed. Specific details on how missing values were handled cannot be determined from the given information.   

3.Text Cleaning: The job description column likely underwent text cleaning to remove unnecessary characters, punctuation, and newline characters ("\n").  

## Transformation Steps:

1.Column Renaming: The column names were transformed to have consistent formatting, likely in lowercase or standardized format.  

2.Feature Engineering: Additional features or columns were created based on the existing data. The specific details of feature engineering cannot be determined from the given information.   

3.Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical variables, such as company size, type of ownership, industry, and sector, were likely encoded to numerical values for further analysis.    

## Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Descriptive Statistics: Basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc., were calculated to summarize the numeric columns.

2. Distribution Analysis: The distributions of numeric variables were analyzed using histograms, box plots, or density plots.

3. Correlation Analysis: The relationships between variables were explored using correlation matrices or scatter plots.

4. Categorical Variable Analysis: The distributions and frequencies of categorical variables were examined using bar charts or pie charts.


## Conclusion
The cleaning, transformation, and EDA processes on the Glassdoor Data Science Jobs dataset provide valuable insights into the characteristics and trends of data science jobs. The findings from this analysis can be used for further analysis or modeling tasks related to data science job market analysis or job recommendation systems.
